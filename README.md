# Description
This project demonstrates
- Applying types to component props
- Applying types to state in component
- Types with event handlers

# FIX ME
Component Child.tsx and Parent.tsx doesn't work when a child property is passed to Child component from Parent component

### Notes
Create react project with typescript support
```shell
npx create-react-app 02-react-ts-components --template typescript
```
